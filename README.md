## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

## API

### [.parse](index.js#L16)

Parses a string and returns an array of `@mention` objects.

**Params**

* `str` **{String}**: Input string to parse looking for @ mentions.
* `fn` **{Function}**: Optional replace function. When passed in, the @ mentions are replaced in the string instead of returned as an array. The new string is returned.

```js
var mentions = parseMentions('Foo @doowb bar @jonschlinkert');
```
